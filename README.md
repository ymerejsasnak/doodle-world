Little interactive thing for my daughter - for practicing css animations/transforms/etc




???
user places them there instead of walking on and off screen?
have max number of guys on screen?
???

make more imgs for each guy type (seems more fun if they all look different) 



add a clear button to clear all guys? (set clearflag = true for .remove method then set it to false again when done?)



try to get ideas to make it more interactive...
-day/night button (night changes sun to moon and lays transparent blue/black div over everything)
(monster comes out at night?)
