Little interactive thing for my daughter - for practicing css animations/transforms/etc





each will be added randomly offscreen on either side
  (maybe also add functionality to add by clicking mouse and delete by clicking too?)
each will have its size randomized
each type may have multiple possible images associated with it (for visual diversity)



other elements:
sun, clouds, trees

types of guys:
walker - crosses screen, rotate back and forth slightly to simulate walking
slider? - faster
flipper - jumps and flips 180degrees
leaper - jumps and flips 360degrees
flyer - flys across screen
rotating flyer - flys across and rotates
dancer - lots of transforms to make him dance across
