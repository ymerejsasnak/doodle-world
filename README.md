Little interactive thing for my daughter - for practicing css animations/transforms/etc



to do:
make more imgs for each guy type (seems more fun if they all look different) 

add a clear button to clear all guys? (set clearflag = true for .remove method then set it to false again when done?)

make buttons look better

make nighttime actually have some functional purpose?
