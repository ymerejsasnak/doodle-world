Little interactive thing for my daughter - for practicing css animations/transforms/etc



to do:
make more imgs for each guy type (seems more fun if they all look different) 

change flipper (sucks) to jumper (stands inplace and jumps and flips 360 degrees)

add a tree button instead of automatically adding trees?

make buttons look better

make nighttime actually have some functional purpose?
