Little interactive thing for my daughter - for practicing css animations/transforms/etc




???
possible ideas:  have walkers change direction sometimes
user places them there instead of walking on and off screen
have max number of guys on screen?
???

make more and better guys!  the more different img, the more fun it seems 


first refactor Guy into a generic parent, then have Walker inherit from that...then add:

jumper - jumps across, flips 360 in jump?
flyer - flys across screen
dancer - lots of transforms to make him dance across






try to get ideas to make it more interactive...
-day/night button (night changes sun to moon and lays transparent black div over everything)
