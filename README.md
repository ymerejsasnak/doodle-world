Little interactive thing for my daughter - for practicing css animations/transforms/etc


!!! need to add code to delete guys when they go off screen
!! also tried to make it a bit faster by using straight JS instead of jQuery for some stuff...but no noticeable effect I think...



possible ideas:  have walkers change direction sometimes
user places them there instead of walking on and off screen
have max number of guys on screen?


each will be added randomly offscreen on either side
  (maybe also add functionality to add by clicking mouse and delete by clicking too?)
each will have its size randomized
each type may have multiple possible images associated with it (for visual diversity)



other elements:
sun, clouds, trees

types of guys:
walker - crosses screen, rotate back and forth slightly to simulate walking
flipper - jumps and flips 180degrees
flyer - flys across screen
dancer - lots of transforms to make him dance across
roller - rolls across
