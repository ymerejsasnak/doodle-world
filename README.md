Little interactive thing for my daughter - for practicing css animations/transforms/etc



to do:
make more imgs for each guy type (seems more fun if they all look different) 

give trees and guys random z-index (in certain range) so some trees are foreground some are background

make nighttime actually have some functional purpose?
