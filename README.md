Little interactive thing for my daughter - for practicing css animations/transforms/etc



to do:
make more imgs for each guy type (seems more fun if they all look different) 

change flipper (sucks) to jumper (stands inplace and jumps and flips 360 degrees)

give trees and guys random z-index (in certain range) so some trees are foreground some are background

make nighttime actually have some functional purpose?
